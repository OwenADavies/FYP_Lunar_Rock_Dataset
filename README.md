As part of my Monash Engineering final year project, I have constructed a dataset of annotated images of rocks in practical simulations of the lunar polar region's low angle and low light conditions for the purpose of training and testing object detection models. 

Datasets are provided in YOLOv8 format and variations of the dataset are available in both colour, and binary infrared images. Images were taken using an Intel RealSense D435 Depth Camera.
